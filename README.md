<h3>WindnTrees</h3>
<p>WindnTrees CRUDS is a front-end http request, response and related content processing javascript library that integrates with Observers to synchronize data between source and view objects. This follows the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data extraction, editing, deletion and saving design pattern.</p>
<p>CRUDS utilize CRUDController to extract information from a data source or CRUDSource and processes response with CRUDProcessor to produce typed objects based on content information. Observers take these typed objects and present them in their appropriate views.</p>
<p>This simplifies the process of data extraction, processing and presentation.</p>
